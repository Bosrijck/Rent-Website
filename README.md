## Rent Website

Hooray for rent automation! Rent Website is a full-stack application written purely in JavaScript using React/Redux for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.

This project draws inspiration from a website written by friend and housemate [Alex Rowe](https://github.com/aprowe) in 2014. We lived in a house with 14 people and rent/utilities was a chore.
